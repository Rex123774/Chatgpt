# Chatgpt
In this project I have used a simple language text model which givs us the response in the form of text when the user uploads text questions to the model.
To use this project uzip the repository and then refer my pdf file
TO process this project you have to create a api key for that you have to go openai.com and after that you have create an account 
After that go to your profile section < View API keys < create new secert key < copy your api key and paste it in ipynb file
This project does not support the multilanguage model , If you want to create other type of applications then you have to implement a strong model 
This is used only for educational purposes only
